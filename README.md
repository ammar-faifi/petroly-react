# Petroly <span style="color: #22eaaa">V2.0</span>

Another major step in the production of our promising project 'Petroly'

---

## Our Goal

Make a smooth shift of our current codebase to a **React.js** framework with the use of next.js while making sure to suffice the following standards:

- Responsive layout for all device sizes
- Uniform and consistent color scheme throughout the website that represents our brand identity (details will be specified in a styling folder )

---

## Project Structure

Our new project structure consists of four main files, which are the following:

- `components`: contains all reusable components such as modals, navbar, etc.
- `pages`: the main navigation parts for each provided service (home screen, evaluation, discussion forums)
- `public`: contains the static assets inside the images folder
- `styles`: contains the css files to style our components

---

## Changes from the former phase

- Main language will become Arabic
- Vertical Navbar with icons instead of text

---

## Tech Stack and packages

- React.js
- next.js
- react-bootstrap
- react-icons
- sass
